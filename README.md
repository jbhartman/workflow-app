<h1>Repository for my personal workflow application</h1>

This application is based on my knowledge of the SCRUM method of project
management.  By default, the application will contain transferable tasks within
categories such as "Not started", "In progress", "Testing", and "Done/Awaiting
integration".  However, these categories will be customizable by the user, with
them able to add, remove, and rename categories.  The tasks contained within
these lists are designed to be transferable between categories and assigned to
particular users.
<br/>
This application is not yet named, but I have a few ideas bouncing around in my head:
<ul>
	<li>COT (customizable organization tool)</li>
	<li>Flow (<i>seems lazy, but it's a thought</i>)</li>
</ul>

Feel free to contact me at any time at jabrhartman@gmail.com.
